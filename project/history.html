	<h1>History of Edinburgh</h1>
	<h2>How it Started</h2>
	<p>Edinburgh’s first occupants were a Celtic tribe. After the Goddodin, descendents of the Britannic tribes that fought the Romans, arrived, they built a small hillfort. The small hillfort was named “Dun Eiden” which means “the fort on the hill slope.” In the year 638, Angles invaded the fort and renamed it to “Eiden Burh.”</p>
	
	<h2>Medieval and Renaissance Edinburgh</h2>
	<p>In 1130, Edinburgh Castle was built by King Malcolm III and his wife Queen Margaret built the chapel inside it. Both of which can be toured today. In the 13th century, King Edward I captured the castle but after 18 years in 1314, the tenants were kicked out. In order to ensure no one would want the castle, especially the English, the King of Scots Robert the Bruce ordered that the castle be left in a state of disrepair. In 1437, Edinburgh replace Scone as Scotland’s capital. </p>
	
	<h2>Present Day </h2>
	<p>Edinburgh’s prestige received quite the boost after World War Two in the form of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It’s the world’s biggest arts festival and has done the most on putting Scotland in the forefront of world culture than anything else in the city. There was a time in the 1960s when the town was being torn down and rebuilt but the New Town Conservation Committee stepped in and restored the buildings that we alll enjoy today.</p>
