	<h1>Transportation</h1>
	<h3>Edinburgh has four types of transportation!</h3>
	<h4>Walking: If you want to work those muscles and burn some calories, walking is the best transportation for you. Edinburgh is a very condense city so it is quite walkable.</h4>
	<h4>Tram:Trams aren’t great for tourists but they are quite useful for getting back and forth between the town and the airport. </h4>
	<h4>Taxis: Taxis in Edinburgh work the same as taxis anywhere else. Just flag them down and get to your destination. Depending on how much you travel, this option could rack up quite the expense.</h4>
	<h4>Buses: This option is the most convenient for tourists. Although the bus has only one route, it passes by many of the town’s main attractions. This option is cheaper than the taxis and more accessible.</h4>
