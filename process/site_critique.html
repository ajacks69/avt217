	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>Incredibly easy to navigate between different areas. Areas are labelled efficiently. Buttons lead to new links.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Buttons light up when you hover over them. Interactive and very easy to use.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>Font matches the band's vibe and aesthetic. The font color does not clash with the background. Headers stand out. Image of the recent album font is used and looks great.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>Love the style and animations on the website. Very attention grabbing and interactive. Colors are pleasant to look at.</p>
